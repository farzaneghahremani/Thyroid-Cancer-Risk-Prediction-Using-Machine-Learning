# Thyroid-Cancer-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts thyroid cancer risk using machine learning techniques. PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction, and an SVM model is trained to classify risk levels. The approach enhances accuracy while addressing class imbalance, supporting early detection and better diagnosis.
